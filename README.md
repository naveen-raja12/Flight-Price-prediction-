# Flight-Price-prediction
Performed regression technique on flight price data set 

Project Title- Flight Price Prediction Description- 1.In this project created a tool that estimates Flight Prices to help users look for best prices when booking flight tickets. 2.This project was challanging for me because all independent fearures were of categorical type.To convert it into numeric values LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder were required. 3.I userd Regression type of algorithm to continuous type of target variable.(I worked on Flight Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor) 4.In this dataset i used MAE,MSE,RMSE.Main goal is to reduce the MSE as much as possible.The RMSE is square root of MSE.The mean absolute error(MAE) is an indication of how close your predictions are, on average, to the actual values of the test data. 5.In this project i used scatter plot which give me plot values in increasing order. 6.CV(cross validation)provides the ability to estimate model performance on unseen data not used while training. 7.Feature Engineering is the important process used to extracting and organizing the important features from raw data in such a way that it fits the purpose of the machine learning model. 8.I also used the Hyperparameter Tunning to enhance the performance of a machine learning model. In this way i used different techniques to achieve my goal that is prediction of flight PRICE.
